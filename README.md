  Ocean Pollution
</h1>
Mass-produced plastics were introduced to the market around the middle of the last century as a wonderful material - light, flexible, durable and strong. Since then, plastic production has grown rapidly, bringing many benefits to society. Currently, about 70 years later, the annual production of plastics is over 300 million tons and we began to understand the true "legacy" of these products: they never really disappear from the environment.

At first glance, it appears that pollution of the oceans and seas causes developed maritime traffic and human activity in the oceans. Water reservoirs traverse thousands of vessels: from fishing and container ships transporting goods and raw materials, to large tourist vessels and military ships. Drilling platforms and installations resembling large factories were built on the surface of the seas. They generate waste, however, according to scientists' estimates - they constitute a smaller percentage of the overall pollution of water bodies.

Only 10 percent of total marine pollution are elements of fishing gears thrown into the water (over 600,000 tonnes per year) or other parts of vessels' equipment. 80% substances that pollute the seas and oceans arise on land. They do not always come from industrial activities or daily human activities in coastal areas. The huge pollution of coastal beaches is also a big problem. On the slightly over 100-meter stretch of beach on the Atlantic coast of Europe you can find an average of 700 larger plastic waste!

However, the largest amount of pollution goes to waters through rivers, winds and floods. They are able to carry plastic waste over a distance of thousands of kilometers. In connection with the sea currents and the planet's rotational movement, the plastic particles sometimes decomposing for several hundred years form extensive "shoals" of expanding garbage on the surface of the seas.

70 percent of the Earth's surface is covered by seas and oceans. Every year, over 10 million tons of plastic and other plastic waste goes there. These pollutants threaten not only the flora and fauna of the sea, but also the health of people living inland
