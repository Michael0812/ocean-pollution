  Ocean Pollution
</h1>
Mass-produced plastics were introduced to the market around the middle of the last century as a wonderful material - light, flexible, durable and strong. Since then, plastic production has grown rapidly, bringing many benefits to society. Currently, about 70 years later, the annual production of plastics is over 300 million tons and we began to understand the true "legacy" of these products: they never really disappear from the environment.

At first glance, it appears that pollution of the oceans and seas causes developed maritime traffic and human activity in the oceans. Water reservoirs traverse thousands of vessels: from fishing and container ships transporting goods and raw materials, to large tourist vessels and military ships. Drilling platforms and installations resembling large factories were built on the surface of the seas. They generate waste, however, according to scientists' estimates - they constitute a smaller percentage of the overall pollution of water bodies.

Only 10 percent of total marine pollution are elements of fishing gears thrown into the water (over 600,000 tonnes per year) or other parts of vessels' equipment. 80% substances that pollute the seas and oceans arise on land. They do not always come from industrial activities or daily human activities in coastal areas. The huge pollution of coastal beaches is also a big problem. On the slightly over 100-meter stretch of beach on the Atlantic coast of Europe you can find an average of 700 larger plastic waste!

However, the largest amount of pollution goes to waters through rivers, winds and floods. They are able to carry plastic waste over a distance of thousands of kilometers. In connection with the sea currents and the planet's rotational movement, the plastic particles sometimes decomposing for several hundred years form extensive "shoals" of expanding garbage on the surface of the seas.

70 percent of the Earth's surface is covered by seas and oceans. Every year, over 10 million tons of plastic and other plastic waste goes there. These pollutants threaten not only the flora and fauna of the sea, but also the health of people living inland

## What this is website for
This website is for everyone, however I was mainly aiming at young people who show interest, and would like to learn a bit more about ocean pollution and what to do to help with this issue.

Nowadays, its more popular to hear people talking global warming, climate changes and how people managed to destroy our world within few decades. Only just recently, on the 20th September Global Climate Stirke took place, it was series of strikes and protests to demand action to be taken to address climate change.

Keeping all of these in mind, I am still aware that many people have a little or no knowledge on how to help to keep our planet healthier and making it happy place to live on for us and our kids.

Bearing all of this in mind I thought us, young people still have the time to make huge change, therefore I wanted to inform and educate people about what is currently happening to our oceans (there is not enough in media).

I really wanted the website to have modern cool design, with short and punchy messaging. I wanted to people to take an action and support [Greenpeace](https://www.greenpeace.org.uk/support-us/) by donating money and changing their habits. It is a one pager website therefore it doesn’t take long to go through all of the info, it is perfect for sharing on social media.

## Existing featurers

#### Logo
The power of the logo lies in its visual nature. According to all studies, they recognise and bind with images or much faster than with text. That is the reason why logo contains drop of water and text **Ocean Polution**. It was created so that it would be associated with water/ocean as much as possible.

On this website logo is located in navbar on the left hand side and at the bottom of website in the footer section. It is vissible on all of devices. 

#### Navbar
It is positioned at the top of the website. For a better UX on smaller devices navbar is changed to toogle navbar.  **Position:sticky** were used to improve user navigation.

Links located in navbar are connect with section on the website as it is one pager site:
- Home - goes to the home page of the website (refresh or send to the top of the website)
- Human Errors - goes to the human errors section
- Solutions - goes to the solutions section
- Contact Us - goes to the to footer to show contact details
- Support Us - it is connect to the [Greenpeace](https://www.greenpeace.org.uk/challenges/plastic-pollution/) website where you can help and support his charity

#### Banner Video
A video ad offers dynamism, and can grab your audiences’ attention more than static images ever can. When I found this video I thought it could be a really nicely used in a banner to show people how beautiful underwater life is, so they can try to keep it the same. ***It is never to late to care about ocean*** as a headline perfectly explains to user what this website is about and gives them a brief idea of what they can expect to find.

#### Human Errors
Idea to create **human errors** section was to show the user how human decission affect ocean pollution. Users can read about three most popular accidents, where human mistake made catastophe and contaminate oceans, the coral reefs and killed many animals.

#### Google Map
I have used google maps to show users how polluted our oceans are. They can "travel" around the map and click on each of the oceans to find out a bit more info about each specific one. This will help people understand that the issue of pollution is a world wide problem. 

#### Solutions
In this section the user can find 4 solutions on how to save our planet. These are very easy to implement in our lives for a start. It is not just about oceans, but about every sphere of our lives. Each of us should change few habits in our life and start to take care of the place in which we live, if not for us we have to do this for our children and the future generations.

#### Support CTA 
This section is a CTA that call people to support [Greenpeace](https://www.greenpeace.org.uk/support-us/). At this stage I am hoping for the user to be educated enough and enourged to support the charity. Greenpeace is a chairty where people could find out more about ocean pollution topic, find more ways to help the enviroment and donate money. I have decided to make it a bit more visual and exciting, also I have used a strong language, as call to actions should attract and encourage people to... take action!


#### Footer
Logo in the footer takes the user back to the top of the website. It consist contact details such as address, phone numbers and also connects to social media:

## Motivation

 The motivation for creating this project is the current health of the oceans.  Many people are unaware of how polluted the oceans are and how many creatures and plants are dying out. In this project I wanted to show users some information on this topic and how even a small action can help.  We may think that one piece of paper, one bottle etc. will not change anything, but it is not true. All small actions matter and it will only depend on us where we will live.
 I hope people change their thinking and start chnging our world for a better place. **Let us give our voice for those who cannot speak!**
