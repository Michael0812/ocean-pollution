## Testing

This site was tested across multiple browsers (Chrome, Safari, Internet Explorer, FireFox). Also, the following tools were used to constantly test each change that I made to my project and to ensure that it appeared in the desired way on different screen sizes:

- [Google Chrome's Development](https://www.google.com/chrome/dev/)

- [Responsinator](http://www.responsinator.com)

- [Am I Responsive](http://ami.responsivedesign.is/#)

- [Responsive test tool](http://responsivetesttool.com)

In addition to my own testing, I also asked family members, friends and the Slack community to test my website and provide any feedback to make sure website is responsive and everything works correctly.
